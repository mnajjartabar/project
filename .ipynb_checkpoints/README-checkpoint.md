## Estimation of soil water content in the entire root-zone

**Name**: Pedro Rossini <br/>
**Project area**: Agronomy - soil water ralations


## Objective
Implement in python an exponential filter equation to estimate daily soil water content (SWC) of the entire root-zone from daily surface observations.


## Motivation and Methodology

Water stress is considered one of the main limiting factors in summer crop yield. Monitoring SWC of the entire root- zone during the crop seasson is a key factor to improve management irrigation practices and reduce the yield gaps. Solutions like multy depth soil moisture sensors within a field are laborious and expensive for farmers to implemmet.

The exponential filter equation is a known analytical method, that is widely used to predict a SWC of the root-zone from surface soil moisture observation time series. Soil profile is divided in two layers: surface and sub-surface, and the objetive is to predict the sub-surface soil moisture from observed measurement at surface layer (Wagner et al., 1999).  

Albergel et. al., (2008) presented a recursive equation to simplify the calculations:


  $$SWI_{2(t)} = SWI_{2(t-1)} + K_t [\text{vwc}_{(t)} - SWI_{2(t-1)}]$$
  
Where $SWI_2$ represent the soil water index of the second layer, $\text vwc_{(t)}$ represents the measured soil moisture at the surface layer, $K$ is the gain of the exponential filter that gets values between 0 and 1, and $t$ is the day of measurement. $SWI_2$ is a scaled soil moisture content and ranges between 0 to 1 based on the minimum and maximum values of each time series.  

In order to get the estimated soil water content at the second layer $SWC_{2(t)}$ is necessary to re-scale the $SWI_2$ by using the maximum $W_{2 max}$ and minimum $W_{2 min}$ soil moisture from the second layer as follows:


  $$SWC_{2(t)} = SWI_{2(t)}(W_{2 max} - W_{2 min}) + W_{2 min}$$

The prediction of $profileSWC_{(t)}$ will be obteined by coupling the observed soil moisture at surface $\text vwc_{(t)}$ and the re-scaled $SWC_{2(t)}$ as:


$$profileSWC_{(t)} = SWC_{2(t)} * L2 + \text vwc_{(t)} * L1$$

where L1 and L2 are the thick of first and second soil layer in milimeters.

##### Initial parameters

Initial $SWI_2$ (t=1) will be estimated using soil moisture observation (0-5 cm depth) at initial time divided by the maximum amount of water that the layer can hold. 

Initial value for $profileSWC$ (t=1) will be estimated using soil moisture observation (0-5 cm depth) at initial time multiplied by the length of the first layer (mm) plus the diference between maximum and minimum water holding capacity of the sub-surface layer multiply by the length of the second layer (mm).


#### Data used to test the model

In this work, daily soil moisture observations at 5 cm depth ($\text vwc_{(t)}$) from Kansas mesonet stations were used as model input to predict profile soil moisture from 0 to 50 cm depth (also know as root-zone). In addition, soil moisture observations at 10, 20, and 50 cm depth from Kansas mesonet stations were used to test the model outputs.

The model was tested in eight stations during 2018 between April to November because we are focused on testing the model during summer crop season, and to avoid interference of freezing temperatures during the winter in soil moisture readings.


##### Kansas mesonet stations and geographic distribution

Mesonet stations across the state were selected taking into consideracion variability of soils types, soil texture, average anual precipitation and land use (rainfed crops, irrigated crops, natural granssland)

## Results 

Soil water content for the entire root-zone (0 to 50 cm) was predicted successfully for a range of mesonet stations showing consistent results and reasonable accuracy. Following is presented the result of the model predictions against the observed data from the station during the study period.
